# Customer Profile View Mode Feature

## Overview
This feature implements a view/edit mode toggle for the customer profile page. By default, the profile is displayed in view mode with an "Edit Profile" button. Users can switch to edit mode to update their information.

## Implementation Details

### 1. View Structure
- Added two distinct sections: view mode and edit mode
- View mode displays profile information in a read-only format
- Edit mode contains the original form for updating profile information
- Only one mode is visible at a time

### 2. Default Behavior
- Profile page loads in view mode by default
- Edit form is hidden initially
- "Edit Profile" button is displayed in view mode

### 3. Mode Switching
- Clicking "Edit Profile" button switches to edit mode
- Clicking "Cancel" button in edit mode returns to view mode
- If validation errors occur, page remains in edit mode to show errors

### 4. Styling
- Added CSS for view mode to improve readability
- Used Bootstrap classes for consistent styling
- Maintained existing color scheme and design elements

### 5. JavaScript Functionality
- Added event listeners for mode switching
- Preserved existing validation functionality
- Maintained phone number formatting logic

## User Experience
- Clear separation between viewing and editing profile information
- Intuitive toggle between modes
- Error handling that keeps users in edit mode when needed
- Consistent with existing application design

## Technical Details
- Uses pure JavaScript for mode switching (no external dependencies)
- Preserves all existing form functionality
- Maintains compatibility with server-side validation
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
