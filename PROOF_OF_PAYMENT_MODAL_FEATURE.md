# Proof of Payment Modal Feature

## Overview
Added clickable modal functionality to the Proof of Payment image in the admin order details page, allowing admin/staff users to view the full-size GCash receipt image.

## Feature Details

### What Was Added
1. **Clickable Image**: The proof of payment thumbnail in the order details page is now clickable
2. **Full-Screen Modal**: Clicking the image opens a Bootstrap modal displaying the full-size image
3. **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects to indicate the image is clickable
4. **Additional Actions**: 
   - View full image in modal
   - Open image in new tab for printing/downloading
   - Close button to return to order details

### User Experience Improvements
- **Visual Indicator**: "Click image to enlarge" text below the thumbnail
