# Fix for 419 "Page Expired" Error in Admin/Staf Login

## Problem
The admin/staff login was showing a 419 "Page Expired" error, which is Laravel's standard response for CSRF token validation failures.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Session Configuration Issues**: The file-based session driver may have been experiencing issues with file permissions or locking.
2. **APP_URL Mismatch**: The APP_URL in the .env file was set to http://localhost but the application was being accessed through http://localhost:8000.
3. **CSRF Token Validation**: The CSRF middleware was properly configured, but session issues were causing token validation to fail.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated APP_URL Configuration
Modified the .env file to match the actual URL being used:
```
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Regenerated Application Key
Ran `php artisan key:generate` to ensure proper encryption keys.

### 3. Switched to Database Session Driver
Changed the session driver from 'file' to 'database' for more reliable session handling:
- Updated config/session.php to use 'database' driver
- Created sessions table migration with `php artisan session:table`
- Ran migrations to create the sessions table

### 4. Cleared All Caches
Cleared all Laravel caches to ensure configuration changes took effect:
- `php artisan cache:clear`
- `php artisan config:clear`
- `php artisan route:clear`
- `php artisan view:clear`

### 5. Verified CSRF Token Generation
Confirmed that the login form properly includes the CSRF token through the `@csrf` directive.

## Testing
After implementing these changes, the admin/staff login should work properly without the 419 error.

## Additional Notes
- The database session driver is more reliable in development environments where file permissions or concurrent access issues might occur with file-based sessions.
- Always ensure the APP_URL matches the actual URL used to access the application.
- Regular cache clearing during development helps prevent configuration-related issues.
