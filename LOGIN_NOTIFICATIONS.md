# Login Notification System

## Overview
This implementation enhances the login system with detailed notifications for both customer and admin/staff users. Users will now receive specific feedback about login failures, including information about remaining attempts before account lockout.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Detailed Error Messages
- **Customer Login**: Specific error messages for different failure scenarios:
  - Invalid email/username
  - Invalid password with remaining attempts count
  - Account suspended
  - Account locked due to multiple failed attempts with countdown timer

- **Admin/Staff Login**: Enhanced error messages:
  - Invalid credentials with remaining attempts count
  - Account locked due to multiple failed attempts with countdown timer

### 2. Remaining Attempts Notification
- Users are informed how many login attempts they have remaining before their account gets locked
- Visual warning displayed when attempts are running low

### 3. Account Lockout Warning
- Clear notification when an account is locked due to multiple failed attempts
- Information about the lockout duration (5 minutes)
- Real-time countdown timer showing seconds remaining

### 4. Success Notifications
- Confirmation messages on successful login
- Welcome messages for returning users

## Technical Implementation

### Services Modified
- **CustomerAuthService**: Enhanced with detailed error reporting, remaining attempts calculation, and lockout timer
- **AdminAuthService**: Added methods for tracking remaining attempts and lockout timer

### Controllers Modified
- **WebAuthController** (Customer): Updated to pass remaining attempts and lockout seconds to the view
- **AuthenticatedSessionController** (Admin): Works with enhanced LoginRequest

### Requests Modified
- **LoginRequest**: Enhanced error messages with remaining attempts information and lockout timer

### Views Modified
- **auth/customer/login.blade.php**: Added error display, attempt notifications, and lockout timer with JavaScript countdown
- **auth/login.blade.php**: Added error display section

## How It Works

### Customer Login Flow
1. User enters email/username and password
2. System checks if account is locked (3 failed attempts within 5 minutes)
3. If locked, shows lockout message with real-time countdown
4. If not locked, validates credentials
5. On failure:
   - If it's the third failed attempt, shows lockout message
   - Otherwise, shows specific error message with remaining attempts count
6. On success, logs user in and shows welcome message

### Admin/Staff Login Flow
1. User enters email and password
2. System checks if account is locked (3 failed attempts within 5 minutes)
3. If locked, shows lockout message with real-time countdown
4. If not locked, validates credentials through Laravel's Auth system
5. On failure:
   - If it's the third failed attempt, shows lockout message
   - Otherwise, shows enhanced error message with remaining attempts count
6. On success, logs user in and redirects to dashboard

## User Experience Improvements
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Proactive warnings about account lockout
- Consistent notification styling
- Helpful links for account recovery
- Visual distinction between different types of errors
- Real-time countdown timer for lockout period

## Security Features
- Maintains existing brute force protection (3 attempts, 5-minute lockout)
- Tracks all login attempts in the database
- Provides detailed logging for security monitoring
- Doesn't reveal whether an email/username exists in the system (except for validation)
- Real-time lockout timer to prevent guessing attacks

## Testing
The system has been tested with various scenarios:
- Valid credentials
- Invalid email/username
- Invalid password
- Account suspension
- Account lockout after 3 failed attempts
- Successful login after failed attempts
- Lockout timer countdown functionality
