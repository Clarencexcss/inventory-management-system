# Reports Access Restored - Navigation Fixed

## ✅ Issue Resolved

### Problem
The navbar "Reports" link was pointing directly to Sales Analytics (`reports.sales.analytics`), bypassing the main Reports Dashboard where all other reports are accessible.

### Solution
Updated the navbar to point to the **Reports Dashboard** (`reports.index`) which displays cards for all available reports.
