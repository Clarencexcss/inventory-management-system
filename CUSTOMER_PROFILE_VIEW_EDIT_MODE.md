# Customer Profile View/Edit Mode Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a view/edit mode toggle for the customer profile page. By default, the profile is displayed in view mode with an "Edit Profile" button. Users can switch to edit mode to update their information.

## Implementation Details

### 1. File Structure
The implementation is contained in a single file:
- `resources/views/customer/profile.blade.php` - Main profile view with view/edit mode functionality

### 2. View Structure
Two distinct sections were added to the profile page:

#### View Mode
- Displays customer profile information in a read-only format
- Uses `form-control-plaintext` class for clean presentation
- Shows profile photo if available
- Includes an "Edit Profile" button to switch to edit mode

#### Edit Mode
- Contains the original form for updating profile information
- Hidden by default using inline CSS
- Includes all form fields from the previous implementation
- Maintains all validation functionality

### 3. Default Behavior
- Profile page loads in view mode by default (`display: block` for view mode, `display: none` for edit mode)
- Edit form is hidden initially
- "Edit Profile" button is displayed in view mode

### 4. Mode Switching
- Clicking "Edit Profile" button switches to edit mode (hides view mode, shows edit mode)
- Clicking "Cancel" button in edit mode returns to view mode (hides edit mode, shows view mode)
- If validation errors occur, page remains in edit mode to show errors

### 5. Styling
CSS was added to improve the readability of view mode:
```css
/* View mode styling */
.form-control-plaintext {
    padding: 0.375rem 0;
    border-bottom: 1px dashed #dee2e6;
}

.form-control-plaintext:focus {
    outline: none;
    border-color: inherit;
    box-shadow: none;
}
```

### 6. JavaScript Functionality
JavaScript was added to handle mode switching:
```javascript
// Toggle between view and edit modes
const editProfileBtn = document.getElementById('editProfileBtn');
const cancelEditBtn = document.getElementById('cancelEditBtn');
const viewMode = document.getElementById('viewMode');
const editForm = document.getElementById('editForm');

if (editProfileBtn) {
    editProfileBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
        viewMode.style.display = 'none';
        editForm.style.display = 'block';
    });
}

if (cancelEditBtn) {
    cancelEditBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
        editForm.style.display = 'none';
        viewMode.style.display = 'block';
    });
}
```

### 7. Error Handling
To ensure a good user experience when validation errors occur:
- If there are any validation errors (`$errors->any()`), the page loads in edit mode
- Error messages are displayed next to the relevant fields
- Users can correct errors without losing their input

## User Experience

### Benefits
1. **Clear Separation**: Users can easily distinguish between viewing and editing their profile information
2. **Intuitive Interface**: Simple toggle between modes with clear buttons
3. **Error Handling**: When validation errors occur, users remain in edit mode to correct mistakes
4. **Consistent Design**: Maintains the existing application design and color scheme

### User Flow
1. User navigates to the profile page
2. Profile information is displayed in view mode by default
3. User clicks "Edit Profile" button to switch to edit mode
4. User makes changes to their profile information
5. User clicks "Update Profile" to save changes or "Cancel" to return to view mode
6. If validation errors occur, user remains in edit mode to correct errors

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Uses pure JavaScript for mode switching (no external dependencies)
- Preserves all existing form functionality
- Maintains compatibility with server-side validation
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions

### Code Structure
The implementation follows the existing Blade template structure:
- Uses Bootstrap classes for consistent styling
- Maintains existing color scheme and design elements
- Preserves all existing validation and error handling

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to the controller or routes
- Maintains compatibility with existing validation rules

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to the customer profile page
2. Verify that the page loads in view mode by default
3. Click the "Edit Profile" button
4. Verify that the page switches to edit mode
5. Make some changes to the profile information
6. Click "Cancel" to return to view mode
7. Verify that the page switches back to view mode
8. Click "Edit Profile" again
9. Submit the form with invalid data to trigger validation errors
10. Verify that the page remains in edit mode to display errors

### Automated Testing
No automated tests were added for this feature, but existing tests should continue to pass.

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. Add animation transitions between view and edit modes
2. Implement client-side validation to improve user experience
3. Add a "Save" button in addition to the form submission
4. Implement auto-save functionality

### Considerations
1. Ensure accessibility compliance for screen readers
2. Add keyboard navigation support
3. Consider mobile responsiveness for the toggle interface
