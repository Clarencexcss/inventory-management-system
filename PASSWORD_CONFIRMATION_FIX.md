# Password Confirmation Field Fix

## Issue
The "Confirm New Password" field was showing a validation error "The password confirmation field must be a string" even when left blank, despite being marked as optional.

## Root Cause
The validation rules in `UpdateCustomerRequest` had `required_with:password` but didn't have `nullable`, which caused the validator to fail when the field was empty.

## Solution
Updated the validation rules in `app/Http/Requests/Customer/UpdateCustomerRequest.php`:

### Before
```php
'password_confirmation' => [
    'required_with:password',
    'string',
    'min:8'
],
```

### After
```php
'password_confirmation' => [
    'nullable',
    'string',
    'min:8',
    'required_with:password'
],
```

## Additional Improvements
1. Updated the frontend to clarify that the confirmation field is only required when changing the password
2. Added JavaScript to dynamically set the "required" attribute based on whether a password is entered
3. Added comprehensive testing instructions

## Testing
The fix has been tested with the following scenarios:
1. Leaving both password fields blank (should be valid)
2. Entering a password but leaving confirmation blank (should show error)
3. Entering matching password and confirmation (should be valid)
4. Entering non-matching password and confirmation (should show error)

All tests pass successfully.
