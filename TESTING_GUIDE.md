## üîç What to Check in Database

### For Product Images:
```sql
-- Check if product image was saved
SELECT id, name, code, product_image 
FROM products 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### For GCash Receipts:
```sql
-- Check if GCash receipt was saved
SELECT id, invoice_no, payment_type, gcash_reference, proof_of_payment 
FROM orders 
WHERE payment_type = 'gcash'
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## üìÅ File Locations

### Product Images:
- **Storage Location**: `storage/app/public/products/[filename]`
- **Public URL**: `http://localhost/storage/products/[filename]`
- **Database Field**: `products.product_image`

### GCash Receipts:
- **Storage Location**: `storage/app/public/gcash_receipts/[filename]`
- **Public URL**: `http://localhost/storage/gcash_receipts/[filename]`
- **Database Field**: `orders.proof_of_payment`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "404 Not Found" when viewing image
**Solution**: Run `php artisan storage:link` (already done)

### Issue: Upload fails silently
**Solutions**:
1. Check PHP upload limits in php.ini
2. Check file size (max 2MB for both)
3. Check file format (JPG, PNG, WEBP for products; JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG for receipts)
4. Check storage folder permissions

### Issue: Image saves but doesn't display
**Solutions**:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check browser console for 404 errors
3. Verify file exists: `dir storage\app\public\products`
4. Verify symbolic link: `dir public\storage`
