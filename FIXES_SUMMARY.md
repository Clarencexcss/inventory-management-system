## Issue 1: Product Creation Error ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When creating a product from the admin side, the system showed error: "Oops... Something went wrong while creating the product"

### Root Cause
1. The `StoreProductRequest` validation rules didn't include the `code` field
2. The product code generation was handled in the controller but wasn't properly integrated with the validation
3. Missing proper error messaging to show the actual error to developers

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Requests/Product/StoreProductRequest.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Product/ProductController.php`

**Changes:**
1. **StoreProductRequest.php:**
   - Added `code` field to validation rules as `nullable|string|unique:products`
   - Moved code generation logic to `prepareForValidation()` method
   - Code is now auto-generated before validation if not provided
   - Ensures unique code generation using `PC{UNIQID}` format

2. **ProductController.php:**
   - Removed redundant code generation logic from `store()` method
   - Improved error handling to show actual exception message
   - Added `withInput()` to preserve form data on error

## Issue 2: Remove Tax/VAT Everywhere ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The system was calculating and displaying 12% VAT/Tax in cart, checkout, and order details for both admin/staff and customer views. Client requested complete removal of tax calculations.

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
1. `resources/views/customer/cart/index.blade.php`
2. `resources/views/customer/checkout/index.blade.php`
3. `resources/views/customer/order-details.blade.php`
4. `resources/views/orders/show.blade.php` (Admin/Staff view)
5. `app/Http/Controllers/Customer/CartController.php`
6. `app/Http/Controllers/Customer/CheckoutController.php`
7. `app/Http/Controllers/Customer/OrderController.php`

**Changes:**

### Customer Cart View (`customer/cart/index.blade.php`)
- **Before:**
  ```
  Subtotal: ₱X,XXX.XX
  Tax (12%): ₱XXX.XX
  ────────────────────
  Total: ₱X,XXX.XX
  ```
- **After:**
  ```
  Subtotal: ₱X,XXX.XX
  ────────────────────
  Total: ₱X,XXX.XX
  ```

### Customer Checkout View (`customer/checkout/index.blade.php`)
- Removed "Tax (12%)" line from order summary
- Total now equals Subtotal (no tax added)

### Customer Order Details View (`customer/order-details.blade.php`)
- **Before:**
  ```
  Subtotal: ₱X,XXX.XX
  VAT (12%): ₱XXX.XX
  Grand Total: ₱X,XXX.XX
  ```
- **After:**
  ```
  Subtotal: ₱X,XXX.XX
  Grand Total: ₱X,XXX.XX
  ```

### Admin/Staff Order Details View (`orders/show.blade.php`)
- **Before:**
  ```
  Paid Amount: XXX
  Due: XXX
  VAT: XXX
  Total: XXX
  ```
- **After:**
  ```
  Paid Amount: XXX
  Due: XXX
  Total: XXX
  ```

### Controllers

#### CartController.php
- Removed `$cartTotal` and `$cartTax` variables
- Only passing `$cartSubtotal` to view
- **Before:** `compact('cartItems', 'cartTotal', 'cartSubtotal', 'cartTax')`
- **After:** `compact('cartItems', 'cartSubtotal')`

#### CheckoutController.php - `index()` method
- Removed tax calculation variables
- **Before:** Passed `$cartTotal`, `$cartSubtotal`, `$cartTax`
- **After:** Only passes `$cartSubtotal`

#### CheckoutController.php - `placeOrder()` method
- **Before:**
  ```php
  $tax = Cart::instance('customer')->tax();
  $total = Cart::instance('customer')->total();
  'vat' => $tax,
  'total' => $total,
  ```
- **After:**
  ```php
  $total = $subTotal; // No tax added
  'vat' => 0,
  'total' => $total,
  ```

#### Customer OrderController.php - `store()` method (API)
- **Before:**
  ```php
  $vat = $subTotal * 0.12; // 12% VAT
  $total = $subTotal + $vat;
  'vat' => $vat,
  ```
- **After:**
  ```php
  $total = $subTotal;
  'vat' => 0,
  ```

## Issue 3: Order Deletion Redirect ✅ FIXED

### Problem
After deleting an order from the admin side, the page showed nothing/blank screen instead of redirecting back to the orders page.

### Root Cause
The `destroy()` method in `OrderController` only deleted the order but didn't return a redirect response.

### Solution
**File Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/Order/OrderController.php`

**Changes:**
- **Before:**
  ```php
  public function destroy(Order $order)
  {
      $order->delete();
  }
  ```
- **After:**
  ```php
  public function destroy(Order $order)
  {
      $order->delete();
      
      return redirect()
          ->route('orders.index')
          ->with('success', 'Order has been deleted successfully!');
  }
  ```

**Behavior:**
- Now redirects to orders list page after deletion
- Shows success message: "Order has been deleted successfully!"
- Proper user feedback for the deletion action

## Additional Notes

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Better Error Handling:**
   - Product creation now shows actual error messages
   - Form data is preserved on validation errors

2. **Code Generation:**
   - Moved to request validation layer (cleaner architecture)
   - Ensures uniqueness before database insertion
   - Follows Laravel best practices

3. **Consistency:**
   - All tax calculations set to 0
   - Total always equals Subtotal across the system
   - Consistent behavior in API and web interfaces

### Database Notes
- The `vat` column in the `orders` table is still present in the database
- It's now always set to `0` instead of being removed
- This approach maintains backward compatibility with existing orders that had VAT

### Cache Cleared
- Ran `php artisan view:clear` to clear compiled blade views
- Ensures all changes take effect immediately
