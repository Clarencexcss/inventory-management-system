## 📋 Changes Summary

### ✅ **Meat Cuts** (Admin Only Actions)
- ❌ Edit button - **HIDDEN for staff**
- ❌ Delete button - **HIDDEN for staff**
- ✅ View - Still available

### ✅ **Orders** (Admin Only Actions)

## 🔑 **How It Works**

All restrictions use: `@if(auth()->user()->isAdmin())`

**Logic:**
- If user role = `admin` → Show all buttons
- If user role = `staff` → Hide restricted buttons
