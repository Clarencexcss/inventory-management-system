## üìã Overview
Complete **Supplier Analytics** feature for ButcherPro that provides comprehensive supplier performance metrics, delivery tracking, and procurement insights using the existing 2 suppliers in the database.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
**Table: `procurements`**
- Stores detailed procurement records for analytics
- Links to existing `suppliers` and `products` tables
- Tracks delivery performance and quality metrics

**Columns:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `supplier_id` - Foreign key to suppliers table
- `product_id` - Foreign key to products table
- `quantity_supplied` - Number of items supplied
- `expected_delivery_date` - When delivery was expected
- `delivery_date` - When delivery actually occurred
- `total_cost` - Total cost of procurement
- `status` - 'on-time' or 'delayed'
- `defective_rate` - Percentage of defective items (0-5%)
- `timestamps` - Created/updated timestamps

**Indexes:** Added for `supplier_id`, `product_id`, `status`, and `delivery_date` for optimal query performance.

---

### 2. Models

#### **Procurement Model** (`app/Models/Procurement.php`)
- Full Eloquent model with relationships
- Belongs to Supplier and Product
- Helper methods:
  - `isOnTime()` - Check if delivery was on time
  - `getDeliveryDelayDays()` - Calculate delay in days
- Proper date casting and decimal precision

#### **Updated Supplier Model** (`app/Models/Supplier.php`)
- Added `procurements()` relationship
- Now has both `purchases()` and `procurements()` relationships

---

### 3. Controller

**`SupplierAnalyticsController`** (`app/Http/Controllers/SupplierAnalyticsController.php`)

**Methods:**

1. **`index()`** - Main dashboard view
   - Loads all analytics data
   - Returns supplier-analytics view

2. **`getSupplierPerformance()`** - Private method
   - Calculates delivery reliability per supplier
   - Computes on-time delivery percentage
   - Calculates average defective rate
   - Computes total costs
   - Generates performance score (0-100)

3. **`getDeliveryTracking()`** - Private method
   - Tracks on-time vs delayed deliveries
   - Calculates percentages

4. **`getProcurementInsights()`** - Private method
   - Total procurement cost

   - Average cost per procurement
   - 30-day trend analysis

5. **`getTopSuppliers()`** - Private method
   - Ranks suppliers by total cost
   - Shows procurement count
   - Average defect rate

6. **`getMonthlyProcurementTrends()`** - Private method
   - Monthly cost trends for last 12 months
   - Procurement count per month

7. **`calculatePerformanceScore()`** - Private method
   - 70% weight on on-time delivery
   - 30% weight on quality (low defective rate)
   - Returns score 0-100

8. **`export()`** - Placeholder for future CSV/PDF export

### 5. Seeder

**`SupplierAnalyticsSeeder`** (`database/seeders/SupplierAnalyticsSeeder.php`)

**Data Generation:**
- Uses ONLY the 2 existing suppliers (Magnolia and A.U)
- Generates 2-4 procurement records per supplier per month
- Covers last 12 months
- 80% on-time delivery rate
- Random defective rates (0-5%)
- Realistic quantities (50-300 units)
- Realistic costs (‚Ç±5,000-‚Ç±150,000)

**Total Records Created:** 66 procurement records

---

### 6. Routes

**Added to `routes/web.php`:**

```php
// Supplier Analytics Routes
Route::get('/reports/supplier-analytics', [SupplierAnalyticsController::class, 'index'])
    ->name('reports.supplier.analytics');
Route::get('/reports/supplier-analytics/export', [SupplierAnalyticsController::class, 'export'])
    ->name('reports.supplier.analytics.export');
```

**Middleware:** `auth`, `role:admin`

---

### 7. Navigation Integration

**Updated `resources/views/reports/index.blade.php`:**
- Changed Supplier Analytics card to link to new analytics page
- Added "Old Report" link to legacy purchases page
- Consistent with Sales Analytics pattern

**Route:** `reports.supplier.analytics`  
**URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/reports/supplier-analytics`

## üìä Analytics Metrics Explained

### Performance Score Calculation
```
Performance Score = (On-Time Rate √ó 0.7) + ((100 - Defective Rate √ó 20) √ó 0.3)
```

**Example:**
- On-Time Rate: 85%
- Defective Rate: 2%
- Score = (85 √ó 0.7) + ((100 - 2√ó20) √ó 0.3) = 59.5 + 18 = **77.5/100**

### Status Badges

**On-Time Delivery:**
- ‚â•80% = Green (Excellent)
- 60-79% = Yellow (Good)
- <60% = Red (Needs Improvement)

**Defective Rate:**
- ‚â§2% = Green (Excellent)
- 2-5% = Yellow (Acceptable)
- >5% = Red (Unacceptable)
