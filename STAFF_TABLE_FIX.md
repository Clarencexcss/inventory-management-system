# Staff Table Error Fix

## Date: 2025-10-15

---

## ❌ Error
```
Something went wrong while creating the product: 
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'staff.user_id' in 'where clause' 
(Connection: mysql, SQL: select * from `staff` where `staff`.`user_id` = 10 and `staff`.`user_id` is not null limit 1)
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The system was trying to access a `staff` table that **doesn't exist** in the database. 

### The Issue:
1. The codebase had references to a `Staff` model and staff relationships
2. However, there's **NO staff table** in the database migrations
3. The system actually uses the `users` table with a `role` column to differentiate between admin/staff/customer
4. When creating a product, the code tried to check if the current user has a staff record by calling `auth()->user()->staff`, which triggered the error

### Affected Code Locations:
1. `ProductController::logProductUpdate()` - Tried to get staff ID from non-existent relationship
2. `User` model - Had a `staff()` relationship pointing to non-existent table
3. `Product` model - Had `updatedByStaff()` relationship pointing to non-existent table

---

## ✅ Solution

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `app/Http/Controllers/Product/ProductController.php`
**Before:**
```php
private function logProductUpdate(Product $product, string $action, array $changes = [])
{
    // Get staff_id if user has a staff record
    $staffId = null;
    if (auth()->user()->staff) {  // ❌ This caused the error
        $staffId = auth()->user()->staff->id;
    }

    ProductUpdateLog::create([
        'product_id' => $product->id,
        'staff_id' => $staffId,
        'user_id' => auth()->id(),
        'action' => $action,
        'changes' => !empty($changes) ? json_encode($changes) : null,
    ]);
}
```

**After:**
```php
private function logProductUpdate(Product $product, string $action, array $changes = [])
{
    ProductUpdateLog::create([
        'product_id' => $product->id,
        'staff_id' => null, // ✅ Staff table doesn't exist, using users table instead
        'user_id' => auth()->id(),
        'action' => $action,
        'changes' => !empty($changes) ? json_encode($changes) : null,
    ]);
}
```

#### 2. `app/Models/User.php`
**Removed:**
```php
/**
 * Get the staff record associated with this user (if any)
 */
public function staff()
{
    return $this->hasOne(Staff::class, 'user_id');
}
```

This relationship was removed because the `staff` table doesn't exist.

#### 3. `app/Models/Product.php`
**Before:**
```php
public function updatedByStaff()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Staff::class, 'updated_by');
}
```

**After:**
```php
public function updatedByUser()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'updated_by');
}
```

Changed to point to the `users` table instead of non-existent `staff` table.

## 📊 System Architecture Clarification

### How Staff Management Works:
- **No separate staff table exists**
- Staff, Admin, and Customer are managed through the `users` table
- The `users.role` column determines the user type:
  - `role = 'admin'` → Administrator
  - `role = 'staff'` → Staff member  
  - `role = 'customer'` → Customer

### Staff-related Features:
The `Staff` model and related code exists for a **different purpose** - it's for staff performance tracking, which is separate from user authentication.

**Two different concepts:**
1. **User Roles** (`users` table) - Authentication & Authorization
2. **Staff Records** (`staff` table - if it exists) - HR/Performance tracking

Since the staff table doesn't exist in this system, we use only the `users` table with roles.

---

## 🎯 Result

✅ **Product creation now works successfully!**
- No more "staff.user_id" column errors
- Products can be created without issues
- Product update logs are created with `user_id` tracking
- `staff_id` is set to `null` in logs (acceptable since user_id tracks who made the change)

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Product Creation:
1. ✅ Log in as admin or staff user
2. ✅ Go to Products → Create Product
3. ✅ Fill in all required fields
4. ✅ Click Create
5. ✅ Should see: "Product has been created with code: PC..."
6. ✅ No SQL errors about staff table

### Verify User Tracking:
```sql
-- Check product_update_logs table
SELECT * FROM product_update_logs ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;

-- You should see:
-- - product_id: populated
-- - staff_id: NULL (this is OK)
-- - user_id: populated with the logged-in user ID
-- - action: 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'
```

## 📋 Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Product/ProductController.php` - Fixed logProductUpdate method
2. ✅ `app/Models/User.php` - Removed non-existent staff relationship
3. ✅ `app/Models/Product.php` - Changed relationship to point to users table

**Total: 3 files modified**

## 💡 Important Notes

### Staff Table Information:
- The `Staff` model exists in `app/Models/Staff.php`
- However, there's **NO migration file** to create the `staff` table
- This suggests the staff table was planned but never implemented
- The system uses `users.role` for staff management instead

### Future Considerations:
If you want to implement a separate staff table in the future:
1. Create a migration for the `staff` table
2. Add `user_id` column as foreign key to link with users
3. Re-enable the relationships we removed
4. Update the `logProductUpdate` method to use staff_id again
